# Model_Indentification_GUI_MATLAB_Implementation
Model Identification algorithms play a vital role in determining process dynamics. After performing bump test, the very next is to identify model dynamics to tune PID controller or MPC. Otherwise, there will be model-plant mismatch. To avoid this a precise model dynamics need to be considered. In this line, I developed model identification tool in MATLAB which takes bump test data in excel (.xlx and xls) formats. Models namely process models (FOPTD, Dual FOPTD), Transfer Function Models and State Space models can be identified.
